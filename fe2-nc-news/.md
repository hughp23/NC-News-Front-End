## General
- [ ] un-nest fe2-nc-news directory in the repo
- [ ] remove `react-project-checklist.md`

## README
- [ ] provides general info about app
- [ ] clear instructions on how to run locally
- [ ] link to API & back end repo
- [ ] specifies minimum versions
- [ ] `package.json` includes dependencies
- [ ] deployed (use `netlify deploy --prod`)

## ux
- [x] Basic styling added
- [ ] Responsive design - *add media queries to reorganise grid?*
- [x] Items aligned
- [ ] Content legible (not too wide, obstructed, etc) *could remove some of the borders/colours to make look more slick*
- [ ] Refreshing doesn’t cause an issue on sub-pages
- [x] No errors in the console *get rid of `console.log`s*
- [ ] Login / Votes / Posts / Deletions happen instantly _OR_ give user indication of loading
- [x] *Could make clearer that if I click on `99 comments` it will show me the comments*

## Functionality
- [x] Some way to log in (should be very obvious to hiring partners)
- [x] Some indication of who is logged in
- [ ] A way to log out *but hosted version goes to netlify page*
- [x] Serves all articles / top articles
- [x] Can vote on articles
- [ ] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load  *can vote up and then down, but not up again, need to rethink the disabling of the buttons*
- [x] Votes are persistent when page is refreshed
- [x] Topic pages load only relevant articles (especially when navigating from one topic page to another)
- [x] Individual articles are served with comments *bad url for article by ID... articles/article/id...*
- [ ] Can vote on comments *BUT can currently vote many times*
- [ ] New comments are persistent *maybe nicer to add comment nearer the top of the comments. Adding comment causes page refresh and netlify error page...*
- [ ] Can only delete comments of logged in user *But deleting comment causes page refresh and netlify error page...*
- [x] Deleted comments don’t re-appear on re-render/refresh
- [ ] Can post an article *"400: articles validation failed..." when trying to post, something about missing created_by*
- [x] User page *needs some form of error for images that break*
- [ ] Users page *can't find it*

Nice search :)

## Error Handling
- [ ] Error pages - *okay but sort netlify*
- [x] All errors handled
  - Navigation: (Bad url / Bad topic slug in url / Bad article id in url / Bad username in url)
  - Login: (Bad username / No username)
  - Post comment: (No text in comment body / Can you post without logging in?) *currently redirect to error page, lets have some user feedback for the comment box instead?*
  - Post article: (No text in article body / No title / No topic selected / Can you post without logging in?) *currently redirect to error page, lets have some user feedback for the add article form instead?*

## Code
- [x] Well named components *Yes, but get rid of `App.test.js`, what is Update Button / delete button / topics ? delete un-used component files. Also what does footer do? Rendering the word footer = wasteful*
- [x] Functional components used where possible *destructure `props` when using functional components*
- [x] `node_modules` git ignored
- [ ] Components reused where possible (`Articles` / `Voter`...) *separate voting functionality to separate reusable component*
- [x] Functions are DRY (`handleChange` for controlled components / api calls) *can use ternary in `getArticles` to look cleaner than if / else*
- [x] Uses object destructuring where possible
- [x] No `console.log`s / comments *remove commented out code and console logs*
- [ ] *Do not fetch user from local storage within `render()` method*
- [ ] *no need to use template literals for ids that are already strings*
- [ ] *topics hard-coded in add article, can we fetch topics and map over them?*

## Stuff to add if you run out of stuff to do...
- [ ] Add integration tests with `cypress`
- [ ] Make sure any code that can be extracted from components is extracted and tested with `Jest`
- [ ] Use `aXe` extension to check for a11y issues
- [ ] Use Context API for sharing logged in user amongst components
- [ ] Add sorting functionality (make sure sort is not in render though)
